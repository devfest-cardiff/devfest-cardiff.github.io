Every year, Google encourage and support the local GDG chapters to organise a [DevFest](https://devfest.withgoogle.com/), but they leave it up each group to decide the size and shape of their event.

GDG Cardiff had the idea of collaborating with all the tech meetups in Cardiff, to organise a "DevFest for *everyone* interested in developing and coding".

We are super excited to announce that AI Wales, Cardiff Go, Cloud Native Wales and Rust/C++ meetups are already on board and more to follow soon!

We're putting together a full day of sessions to learn, socialise and promote diversity in the development community.  See more details about our vision below.

We're looking for sponsors and collaborators to help us achieve it.
