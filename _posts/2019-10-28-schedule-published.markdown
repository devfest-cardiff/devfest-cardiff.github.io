We've finally managed to get all our great speakers into a [schedule](/schedule/).  It wasn't as easy as you'd think - even after we added an extra room to fit them all in!

We've handcrafted a schedule that lets DevFest Cardiff attendees choose their own adventure on the day - Mobile, Web, AI, Cloud or a tour of everything.  We're also excited to to have sessions on career development from our premium sponsors [Yolk](https://www.yolkrecruitment.com)

You can take a [look at the schedule here](/schedule/) and admire our keyboard inspired room naming Enter, Shift, Tab and Alt.
