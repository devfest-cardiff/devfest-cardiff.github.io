Our [call for papers](https://sessionize.com/devfest-cardiff-2019/) is now open. 

Get your submission in by 22nd September and help us create an awesome DevFest Cardiff!

We are looking for a good spread of subject areas and programming languages. Language basics, practical applications, and "How To"s are all welcome! We would, of course, love to hear from speakers able to lead sessions on Google tech, but we welcome all kinds of ideas!
