  speakers: [1]
  subtype: AI
  description: "La Abadía del Crimen is an 8-bit computer game and a perfect challenge for AI (it requires about 10^1000 moves to solve it!). 
  Learn about starting an AI project from zero, We'll look at building a solution using Deep Neural Networks and Monte Carlo Tree Search, and cover the basics of Reinforcement Learning.  
We will see how to start an AI project from zero: defining the objectives, creating the architecture, building the game interfaces,  massive data pipelines,  defining model strategies, how to parallelize everything, etc."

  speakers: [2]
  subtype: Web
  description: "Adding a video can be as easy as adding a video tag and pasting in the source.  But will it playback well?  For everyone?  Even your users on older phones, still on 3G?
In this workshop, we'll walk through thoughtful approaches to adding video - looking at available codecs, compression, streaming vs. full videos, and then the actual steps to adding video to the page.  You'll leave with the knowledge and the tools you'll need to deliver video that plays fast, stalls infrequently and delights all of your users."

  speakers: [2]
  subtype: Mobile
  description: "
  The world of virtual reality allows us to build new 3D interactive spaces that we can fill with anything we want - like the art of the great Renaissance masters. More into Cubism? With a quick click - now the gallery is full of a completely different genre. With new AR features, we can actually build the gallery in our own space - and just as easily swap out the art - all in our browser!
In this talk, we’ll walk through the steps to build a virtual ARt gallery, with web technology available today, but also take a peek at the new WebXR technology that is coming to our browsers soon!"

  speakers: [6]
  subtype: Languages
  description: "UNIX shell scripts are a great way to quickly automate something - until you need to share them with other people, especially people running other operating systems.
In this open workshop, Stuart will show you how to use Golang and the Scriptish library to quickly and easily replace your non-portable UNIX shell scripts with portable, easy-to-distribute single binaries."

  title: "Starting Small: Putting Containers Live With K3S"
  speakers: [6]
  subtype: Cloud
  description: "Many of us use Docker containers for development, but we're not ready to take the leap to running them in production using full-fat Kubernetes (K8S). What if there was a halfway house - a way to get started with Kubernetes at a very small scale? One that doesn't stop you migrating to a larger, managed Kubernetes setup as you grow?
In this guided workshop, Stuart will introduce you to Rancher's K3S: a Kubernetes setup so small you can realistically run it on a £10-a-month VPS. He'll show you how to get your first site up and running, and show you what to keep in mind for when you're ready to migrate to full-fat Kubernetes such as Google's Kubernetes Engine (GKE)."

  title: "XGBoost: from theory to practice"
  speakers: [7]
  subtype: AI
  description: "XGBoost has become one of the go to machine learning algorithms in recent years due to its fast and accurate predictions, as well as the ability to handle very large datasets.
In the first part of the workshop, we will cover the concepts behind XGBoost. From the humble decision tree, to bagging, to random forests, to boosting, and finally to the XGBoost algorithm.
In the second part, we will focus on the implementation of XGBoost in Python/R, and consider practical details such as hyperparameter optimization. Finally, we will use the XGBoost algorithm on a real dataset to make predictions, and compare its performance to other machine learning algorithms."

  title: "The Serverless Application"
  speakers: [8]
  subtype: Cloud
  description: "Serverless platforms are suited to a wide range of applications from IoT & chatbots through to microservices and web hooks. In this session, I’ll introduce you to how serverless applications work and embrace cloud services to live in a world where there are many separate parts that make up the application. I'll cover the architectural patterns we use to design a serverless application including handling their stateless nature, how to use multiple functions for a task and leveraging event processing to trigger further functions. I will then turning my attention to showing you how to put these into practice by looking at how they can be implemented in an Lambda or Apache OpenWhisk.

By the end of the session, you'll understand how serverless applications work and you'll want to start building your own!"

  title: "Prototyping user interfaces using Firebase and Coda"
  speakers: [11]
  subtype: Cloud
  description: "Firebase offers a great web UI for developers to update data directly in their Cloud Firestore. 
Sometimes, for an app or a microsite, we need an interface for our clients to update data. In these cases, often a full-blown CMS isn't appropriate – they're often confusing for clients (as they tend to be designed with page content in mind) – or we spend too much time developing the UI for something quite simple.
Recently, we've started using Coda to prototype user interfaces. Coda is like a combination between a Google Doc and a Sheet. It allows us to create tables and accompanying instructions – with a 'publish now' button that sends the content to Cloud Firestore. We can quickly iterate the admin UI. Better yet, Coda offers great reporting and analysis features, so that data in Firestore can be visualised.
In this talk, we're going to discuss why we chose to use Coda and Firebase together, the benefits, and how we did it."

  title: "Learning Relation Embeddings for NLP"
  speakers: [12]
  subtype: AI
  description: "The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) today is heavily reliant on vector representations
of words (a.k.a word embeddings). These are vector spaces where each word is associated a vector,
and these vectors are learned such that similar words (with similar meanings, like ‘table’ and
‘chair’) are clustered together in the space. These vectors are almost always the input of deep
learning (based on neural networks) models, simply because they provide them “for free” with
knowledge about language and the world.
A recent line of research suggests that these deep learning models can be enriched with relation
embeddings, which are vectors representing the relation between two words, like [rome,italy] or
[cat,feline]. These pairwise vectors are very useful for (1) learning how concepts are related in a
corpus, for example for detecting bias in news writing; and (2) enriching word vectors for better
neural text classifiers, e.g., better sentiment analysis systems.
In this talk I will (1) Provide an introduction to word embeddings; and (2) Introduce relation vectors
and their applications to corpus linguistics and NLP, in both cases with python code support, mostly
using the numpy, gensim and keras libraries."

  speakers: [14]
  subtype: Languages
  description: "
  Do you need to service large user volumes? Does your system need to handle large message volumes and be fault tolerant? You may want Erlang and it's not as scary as you think.

This talk will be a gentle introduction into Erlang, presented by a former Javascript developer. The first part of the talk will go over some basic use cases for the language. In the second part, we will be building up a simple chat application from a starter with a series of tutorials on some of the basic language constructs. Docker containers with tools and starting repos will be provided.

If you've ever been curious about Erlang or functional programming in practice, this is a good place to start."

  speakers: [16]
  subtype: Web
  description: "An all-ages whistle-stop tour through the world of internationali[sz]ation and locali[sz]ation (i18n/l10n): what it is; why it matters; why it’s about more than just language; and why you’re probably doing it wrong. A must-see for devs building apps for international audiences.

In March 2019, the World Wide Web turned 30, but only in the past few years has it really started to live up to that name. Six billion people and 80% of the global economy don’t speak English, and bringing the web to this massive segment of the planet presents challenges that aren’t immediately obvious in the Anglosphere. As developers, we frequently make assumptions about names, addresses, times and places that don’t necessarily hold in other cultures in other parts of the world. In this session, you’ll learn how to avoid some of these pitfalls, and how to better design and build applications with a global audience in mind."
