  company: "Purveyor of poor paternal puns"
  bio: "Chris is a software developer based in Cardiff who enjoys programming now almost as much as when he first sat down at a ZX Spectrum at the age of 8. Almost three decades later, he shares his passion for learning with anyone who’s prepared to listen, and occasionally a few who aren’t. He brings experience from the public, private and third sectors, and the worlds of politics, sport, music and transport. When he’s not working, he’s usually either at a community event or enjoying a good film. He’s still bitter about that time Bonnie Tyler told him she wasn’t going to make a comeback before going on to release another four albums."
